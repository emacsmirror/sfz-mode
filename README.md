# emacs-sfz-mode

This is a major mode for editing SFZ files using GNU Emacs.

It provides syntax coloring, as well as an ability to identify opcodes which are
not part of public specification, and display them in a distinct color.

This will be available in the MELPA repository as the package `sfz-mode`.
Install it from `M-x package-list`.
